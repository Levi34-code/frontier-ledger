FAVICON SETUP
=============

To add your favicon (the mountain logo icon that appears in the browser tab):

1. Take the mountain logo image file you uploaded in the chat
2. Save it to this directory (assets/) as: favicon.png
3. The file should be named exactly: favicon.png
4. Recommended size: 32x32 pixels or 64x64 pixels (PNG format)

The HTML is already configured to use: assets/favicon.png

Once you save the file here, refresh your browser and the icon will appear in the tab!
